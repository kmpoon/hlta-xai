# HLTA for XAI

Hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) has been used for hierarchical topic detection based on co-occurrence of words in documents.  We applied the same technique to find a hierarchy of clusters of labels based on co-occurrence.  The label clusters can be used for explaining the behaviour of classifiers after further processing.

# Running

```java -cp HLTA-XAI.jar xai.hlta.HLTA data_file output_name```
